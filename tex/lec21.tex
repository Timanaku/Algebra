\subsection{Isomorphism of rings and Cancellation}
On first isomorphism theorem for rings, zero divisors, and cancellation.

Recall that a subring $U\subset R$ is an additive subgroup of $R$ such that for all
$r,r'\in U$ we have $rr'\in U$. Morover, if $R$ is unital, we require $1_R\in U$. 

A \emph{two-sided ideal $I$ in a ring $R$ } is an additive subgroup of $R$ such that for
all $x\in I, r\in R$ we have $xr\in I$, $rx\in I$. Note that if $1\in I$, an ideal, then
for every $i\in I$ and $r\in R$, then $ir\in R$, but note that if $i=1$, then $1x=x$, so
we'd require that $I=R$, not a proper ideal. Hence, being an ideal is not a stronger
condition than being a subgroup.

Recall that if $I$ is an ideal, then we define the quotient $R/I$ to be a ring whose
underlying additive group is the quotient of additive groups, with multiplication
$(r+I)(r'+I) = rr'+I$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\phi:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism. The \emph{kernel} of $\phi$ is defined as
  $\ker\phi=\left\{ r\in R : \phi(r)=0_S \right\}$ and the \emph{image} of $\phi$ is
  defined as $\img\phi=\left\{ \phi(r) : r\in R \right\}\subset S$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\phi:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism of (unital) rings. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The kernel $\ker\phi$ is a proper ideal of $R$;
    \item The image $\img\phi$ is a subring of $S$;
    \item $\phi$ induces a ring isomorphism $R/\ker\phi \to \img\phi$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \emph{Kernel:} Note that $\ker\phi$ is an additive subgroup by FIT of groups. Moreover,
  note that for $a\in\ker\phi$ and $r\in R$ we have $\phi(ra)=\phi(r)\phi(a)=\phi(r)0=0$
  so $ra\in\ker\phi$ and similarly for $ar\in\ker\phi$. Then note that $1\not\in\ker \phi$
  since we have that $\phi(1_R)=1_S\neq 0_S$. Hence $\ker\phi\lhd R$.

  \emph{Image:} Note that $\Img\phi$ is an additive subgroup by FIT of groups. Morover, let
  $r,r'\in\img\phi$, so $\phi(ss')=\phi(s)\phi(s')=rr'\in S$ since $S$ is a ring the
  product of two elements of the ring will still be in $S$. Hence the claim follows.

  \emph{Isomorphism:} By FIT for groups, we have that the isomorphism exists for the
  additive group structure. We're left with showing that the homomorphism also holds for
  the multiplicative operation and that it's bijective. We have that the homomorphism is
  multiplicative, hence the map holds under multiplication. Moreover, it's a ring
  homomorphism that is also a bijective, hence the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[In algebraic number theory]
  Consider the homomorphism $\phi: \RR[X]\to \CC:f\mapsto f(i)$. This is a ring
  homomorphism. Its image is all $\CC$, and its kernel is all multiples of $X^2+1$. Hence
  we have $\ker\phi=(X^2+1)\RR[X]$ and by the FIT, $\RR[X]/(x^2+1)\RR[X]\cong \CC$. Note
  that as a vector space, $\CC$ is 2-dim, while $\RR[X]$ is infinitely dimensional. Hence
  we're saying that we just need two basis to represent every coset. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}[In analysis]
  Consider the set of continuous functions on $\RR$, $C^0(\RR)$. This is a ring under
  pointwise addition and multiplication. The evaluation map $\phi:C^0(\RR)\to \RR:f\mapsto
  f(0)$ is a ring homomorphism, where the image is $\RR$ and the kernel is
  $\ker\phi=\{f\in C^0(\RR): f(0)=0\}$, i.e. all the functions that pass through the
  origin. Hence $C^0(\RR)/\ker\phi \cong \RR$.
\end{example}


\begin{theorem}
  Let $F$ be a \emph{field} (a ring which is also a group under multiplication when
  restricted without the addition identity, like $\RR$), and let $R$ be a ring. Then every
  homomorphism $F\to R$ is injective.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\phi:F\to R$ be a ring homomorphism. Assume that $\ker\phi$ is not trivial (hence
  $\phi$ is non-injective). Then there exists non-zero element $f\in F$, $f\in\ker \phi$.
  Then, $\phi(f)=0_R$. Since $F$ is a field, we have $f^{-1}f=e_F$, so
  $\phi(e_F)=0_R$. But we must have $\phi(e_F)=e_R\neq 0_R$. Hence a contradiction.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  Note that we didin't use the fact that $F$ is commutative. In fact, $F$ does not need to
  be field, but just a division ring (non-commutative field).
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  Let $R$ be a ring. An element $a\in R$ is a \emph{left zero divisor} if $a\neq 0$ and
  there exists $b\in R\setminus \{0\}$ s.t. $ab=0$. A right zero divisor is defined
  analogously.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Consider $\ZZ/8\ZZ$. Then $2+8\ZZ$ is a zero divisor since it's non-zero and
  $(2+8\ZZ)(4+8\ZZ)=8+8\ZZ=0+8\ZZ$. 

  Consider $R=\RR[X]/X^2\RR[X]$, so the element $X+X^2\RR[X]$ is a zero divisor, since
  the square of itself is $0+X^2\RR[X]$.
\end{example}


\begin{theorem}
  Let $R$ be a ring. The following are equivalent
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $R$ has not left zero divisors;
    \item $R$ has not right zero divisors;
    \item For all $a,b,c\in R$ with $a\neq 0$, one has $ab=ac$ if and only if $b=c$.
    \item For all $a,b,c\in R$ with $a\neq 0$, one has $ba=ca$ if and only if $b=c$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \label{<+label+>}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We have 1 iff 2 because the definition of $a$ being a left zero divisor means that $b$
  is a right zero divisor.  We have 1 then 3 since, for $ab=ac$ then $ab-ac=a(b-c)=0$,
  where $a\neq 0$ and we have that there are no zero divisors. Hence $b=c$.
  Next show that 3 implies 1 by contrapositive. Suppose that $a$ is a zero divisor, hence
  $ab=ac$. Let $b$ be the element such that $ab=0$ which is non-zero. Then the case where
  $c=0$ we have $ab=0=ac$ but $b\neq 0$. 
\end{proof}
