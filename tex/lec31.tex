\subsection{Field Extensions and Degrees}
\begin{definition}
  Let $F/K$ be a field extension and $\alpha\in F$ be algebraic over $K$. The
  \emph{degree of $\alpha$ over $K$}, written $\deg(\alpha, K)$, is the degree of the
  polynomial $\irr(\alpha, K)$.
  The \emph{degree of $F$ over $K$ }, written $[F:K]$ is the dimension of $F$ as a vector
  space over $K$. An extension $F/K$ is finite if $[F:K]<\infty$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $K(\alpha)$ denote the smallest subfield of $F$ that contain $K$ and $\alpha$, the
  field generated by $\alpha$ over $K$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $F/K$ be a field extension, $\alpha\in F$ be algebraic over $K$. Then
  $[K(\alpha):K]=\deg(\alpha, K)$. More precisely, every element of $K(\alpha)$ can be
  uniquely written as $b_0+b_1\alpha +\cdots b_{d-1}\alpha^{d-1}$ where $d=\deg(\alpha,
  K)$ and $b_i\in K$. In other words, $1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{d-1}$ is a basis for
  $K(\alpha)$ over $K$ as a vector space.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  For uniqueness, suppose $\exists b_i,b_i'\in K$ s.t. 
  \[b_0+b_1\alpha+\cdots+b_{d-1}\alpha^{d-1}=b_0'+\cdots+b_{d-1}'\alpha^{d-1}\]
  And note that then $\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial
  $(b_0-b_1)+\cdots+(b_{d-1}-b_{d-1}')\alpha^{d-1}$. Since $d=\deg\irr(\alpha,K)$ it
  follows that $b_i=b_i'$ for all $i$.

  For existence, suppose $\irr(\alpha, K)=x^d+c_{d-1}x^{d-1}+\cdots+c_0$. Then
  $\alpha^d=-(c_{d-1}\alpha^{d-1}+\cdots +c_0)$, so it is spanned by the stated basis.
  Similarly, $\alpha^{d+1}=-(c_{d-1}\alpha^{d} + c_{d-2}\alpha^{d-1}+\cdots+c_0\alpha)$,
  and note that since we can write $\alpha^d$ as a linear combination of
  $\alpha^{d-1},\cdots, 1$, so can be $\alpha^{d+1}$. Inductively, this is true for any
  power of $\alpha$, and so the span of $\langle 1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{d-1}\rangle$
  is closed under multiplication (and obviously closed under addition too because it's a
  linea combination). It remains to show that it is closed under multiplicative inverses.
  Consider the ring homomorphism $K[X]\to F:f(x)\mapsto f(\alpha)$, where the image is
  $\langle 1,\alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{d-1}\rangle$, and the kernel consists of the
  multiples of the minimal polynomial, i.e. $(\irr(\alpha, K))$. By the first isomorphism
  theorem of rings we have $K[X]/(\irr(\alpha,K))\cong \langle 1,\alpha, \cdots,
  \alpha^{d-1}\rangle$, which is a field since $(\irr(\alpha, K))$ is maximal.
\end{proof}
