\subsection{Not Burnside's Lemma}
Applications of Cauchy's Theorem and Burnside's lemma (not Burnside's work!)
\begin{example} [Classify groups of order 6]
  Let $G$ be a group of order $6$. Then $G$ is either cyclic or isomorphic to $S_3\equiv
  D_{2\cdot 3}$.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
  Cauchy Theorem suggest that there exists an element of $h\in G$ of order $2$ and an
  element $g\in G$ of order $3$. Notice that $K=\langle g \rangle$ will have index $2$ by
  Lagrange, and so by Theorem \ref{thm:cauchyGeneral} it must be normal in $G$. Since $K$
  is normal, it means that conjugation by $h$ will preserve the subgroup meaning that
  $hgh^{-1}\in K$. In particular, conjugation by $h$ defines an automorphism on $K$. 

  We claim that $\phi_K:K\to K: g^i\to hg^ih^{-1}$ is an isomorphism. Since $K$ is normal,
  we're guaranteed to have $hg^ig^{-1}\in K$ for any $i$. Furthermore, we claim we have an
  homomorphism. For $g',g''\in K$ we have $\phi_K(g'g'')=hg'g''h^{-1}=
  hg'h^{-1}hg''h^{-1}=\phi_K(g')\phi_K(g'')$, hence we indeed have a group homomorphism.
  Finally, note that the inverse of $\phi_K$ is just $\phi_K^2$ since $h$ has order $2$,
  $\phi_K^2(g)=h(hgh^{-1})h^{-1}= h^2 g h^{-2} = g$, hence $\phi_K$ is indeed bijection. But
  the set of automorphism on $K$ of prime order must have size $p-1$ (we proved this in week
  2 exercise sheet), hence we should have $2$ automorphisms. Indeed we have $g\mapsto g$ and
  $g\mapsto g^2$. We found that $\phi_K$ is an automorphism so it must be one of these two.
  In \emph{case 1} we consider $hgh^{-1}=g$, so $hg=gh$, so 
  \[G=\langle g,h | g^3=e=h^2, gh=hg \rangle\]
  So $G=\langle g \rangle \times \langle h \rangle$, which is cyclic by exercise sheet 2.
  In particular, $G=\langle gh \rangle$.

  In \emph{case 2} we consider $hgh^{-1}=g^{-1}$, so we have
  \[G=\langle g,h | g^3=e=h^2, hg=g^{-1}h\rangle\]
  Which is the Dihedral group of order $6$, and this is isomorphic to $S_3$. Furthermore,
  by Theorem \ref{thm:cauchyGeneral} the subgroup of order $3$ is normal in $G$, since it
  has index 2. When the group is normal, the subgroups 
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}
  Let $G$ be a group and $X$ be a $G$-set. Let $g\in G$. Define
  \[X^g=\left\{ x\in X : g\cdot x =x \right\} \subset X\]
  The elements of $x$ that are fixed by $g$. Note that this definition is closely related
  to the stabiliser definition, but it's different.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $G$ be a group and $X$ be a $G$-set. The set of $G$-orbits of $X$ is denoted by
  $X/G$. Thus we have $X=\bigsqcup_{O\in X/G} O$ (note, disjoint union).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[non-Burn's lemma]
  Let $G$ be a group and $X$ be a $G$-set. We have 
  \[|X/G|=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} |X^g|\]
  \label{thm:notBurnside}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider the set $S=\left\{ (g,x)\in G\times X : gx=x \right\}$. We aim to count $|S|$.
  On the one side, we can go over each element of $G$ and find every $x$ for which that
  $g$ has $gx=x$, and that's exactly $|X^g|$, hence $|S|=\sum_{g\in G} |X^g|$.

  On the other hand, we can go over each element $x\in X$ and find every $g\in G$ for which
  that $x$ has $gx=x$. That's just $|\Stab_G x|= |G|/|\Orb x|$ (by the Orbit Stabilizer
  theorem). Then, 
  \[|S|= \sum_{x\in X} |\Stab_G x|= \sum_{x\in X} \frac{|G|}{|\Orb x|}= |G|
  \sum_{O\in X/G} \sum_{x\in O} \frac{1}{|O|}= |G|\sum_{O\in X/G} 1 = |G||X/G|\]
  Hence
  \[|G||X/G| = \sum_{g\in G} |X^g|\]
  As required.
\end{proof}

Recall that an orbit of a $G$-set is the set of points that becomes
\emph{indistinguishable} under the symmetries of the set under the group action, since the
actions themselves encode symmetries of the set. So,
\begin{remark}
  Orbit counting is just counting the objects of a $G$-set up to symmetry.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
  How many essentially different ways are there of coloring the sides of a triangle using
  four colours?  Essentially different in that one coloring cannot be obtained from the
  other by applying symmetries of the triangle.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
  A naive way of approaching this is counting each possible coloring and checking them.
  This is exactly the case for not Burnside's lemma. Let $X$ be the set of all genuinely
  different coloring for the triangle sitting still. Then $|X|=4^3=64$. The group $D_6$
  acts on $X$. Two colourings are essentially different if one cannot be obtained from the
  other by applying symmetries of the triangle, i.e. if they lie in different orbits under
  the action of $D_6$. So the number of essentially different colourings is just the
  number of orbits, $|X/G|$.
  \[|X/G|=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma\in D_6}|X^{\sigma}|\]
  Consider the symmetries,
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\sigma=e\implies |X^{\sigma}|=|X|=64$.
    \item $\sigma$ is a reflection, so we require the two faces we're swapping to be the
      same colour. We have 4 choices in the first face, then the opposite wrt the axis of
      symmetry is decided (no choice), and we have 4 choices for the third face. Hence
      $|X^{\sigma}|=16$. Note we're summing over every element of $G$, so we have to
      account this for every reflection: 3 reflections, so there are $3\cdot 16=48$.
    \item $\sigma$ is a (single) rotation. For the colour to be the same, we require all 3 sides to
      be the same. We have $4$ colours, so $|X^{\sigma}|=4$. We have 2 different rotations
      (the third rotation in the triangle is just the identity), so there $2\cdot 4= 8$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Then, by Burnside's,
  \[|X/G|=\frac{1}{6}(64+8+48) = 20\]
\end{proof}
